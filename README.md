# Game of Life

This project is an implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life), a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway.

## Description

The Game of Life is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves.

This implementation includes a visual grid for users to interact with, allowing them to set up initial states for the Game of Life.

## Installation

To install the Game of Life, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Twintersh/game-of-life.git`
2. Navigate into the project directory: `cd game-of-life`
3. This program uses the SDL2 library, you can download it with : \
`sudo apt-get update`\
`sudo apt-get install -y libsdl2-dev`\
`sudo apt-get install -y libsdl2-2.0`


## Usage

To run the Game of Life, use the following command: `make run`

You can set cells simply by clicking, and left click to remove them.

`r` key stand to set screen as a random array of cells
